     * Provide a [Key] used for the initial [load] for the next [PagingSource] due to invalidation
     * of this [PagingSource]. The [Key] is provided to [load] via [LoadParams.key].
     *
     * The [Key] returned by this method should cause [load] to load enough items to
     * fill the viewport around the last accessed position, allowing the next generation to
     * transparently animate in. The last accessed position can be retrieved via
     * [state.anchorPosition][PagingState.anchorPosition], which is typically
     * the top-most or bottom-most item in the viewport due to access being triggered by binding
     * items as they scroll into view.
     *
     * For example, if items are loaded based on integer position keys, you can return
     * [state.anchorPosition][PagingState.anchorPosition].
     *
     * Alternately, if items contain a key used to load, get the key from the item in the page at
     * index [state.anchorPosition][PagingState.anchorPosition].
     *
     * @param state [PagingState] of the currently fetched data, which includes the most recently
     * accessed position in the list via [PagingState.anchorPosition].
     *
     * @return [Key] passed to [load] after invalidation used for initial load of the next
     * generation. The [Key] returned by [getRefreshKey] should load pages centered around
     * user's current viewport. If the correct [Key] cannot be determined, `null` can be returned
     * to allow [load] decide what default key to use.
